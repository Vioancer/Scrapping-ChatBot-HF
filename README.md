We are seeking an engineer skilled in either Python or Node.js to work with the ChatGPT API/NLP in order to develop innovative solutions. The successful candidate will be tasked with the following assignment:

Objective: Create a chatbot using the ChatGPT API that interacts with a given website URL. Although no front end is required, the chatbot must be demonstrable via console.

In this project, the engineer will be responsible for:

1. Setting up the environment: Acquire necessary API keys for ChatGPT and install required libraries/packages for Python or Node.js. Configure the development environment to make API calls efficiently.

2. Extracting data: Create a script to fetch the website's content via the provided URL. Extract relevant information from the website by using web scraping techniques, such as Beautiful Soup for Python or Cheerio for Node.js.

3. Processing data: Identify and structure key information from the scraped content, which can be used as input to the ChatGPT API to generate meaningful responses.

4. Implementing the chatbot: Utilize the ChatGPT API to build the chatbot. Design the chatbot to take user inputs, process them, and generate suitable responses using the information obtained from the website.

5. Console demonstration: Prepare the chatbot to function seamlessly via the console, enabling users to interact with it, provide inputs, and receive relevant responses.
